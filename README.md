# ELK
Bigdata suite using Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana

Used a public dataset which pertains about 34 million records of all the cars (and its features) that were sold in the year 2015. I implemented Elasticsearch on this dataset using logstash and used Kibana to generate business insights such as

1. Top 20 car manufacturers based on number of cars sold
2. Manufacturers broken by fuel type and transmission type
3. Average miles run by cars of different fuel types
4. Average miles run by cars of different fuel types and transmission type
etc

Below is the analytics chart
